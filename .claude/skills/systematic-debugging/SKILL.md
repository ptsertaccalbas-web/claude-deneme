description: Structured debugging methodology that mandates root cause investigation before attempting any fixes. Triggers automatically on test failures, bugs, production errors, build/integration issues, or unexpected behavior.

# Systematic Debugging

## Overview
Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.
**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.
Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.

---

## The Iron Law
> **NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST**  
> If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

---

## When to Use
Use for ANY technical issue:
* Test failures
* Bugs in production
* Unexpected behavior
* Performance problems
* Build failures
* Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
* Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
* "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
* You've already tried multiple fixes
* Previous fix didn't work
* You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
* Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
* You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
* Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

---

## The Four Phases
You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation
BEFORE attempting ANY fix:
1. **Read Error Messages Carefully:**
   * Don't skip past errors or warnings (they often contain the exact solution).
   * Read stack traces completely. Note line numbers, file paths, error codes.
2. **Reproduce Consistently:**
   * Can you trigger it reliably? What are the exact steps?
   * If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess.
3. **Check Recent Changes:**
   * What changed that could cause this? Git diff, recent commits, new dependencies, config changes, environmental differences.
4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems:**
   * WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):
   * BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:
     * For EACH component boundary: Log what data enters/exits, verify env/config propagation, check state at each layer.
     * Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks, THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component.
5. **Trace Data Flow:**
   * Where does bad value originate? What called this with bad value? Keep tracing up until you find the source. Fix at source, not at symptom.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis
Find the pattern before fixing:
1. **Find Working Examples:** Locate similar working code in same codebase.
2. **Compare Against References:** Read reference implementation COMPLETELY.
3. **Identify Differences:** List every difference between working and broken, however small.
4. **Understand Dependencies:** What settings, config, environment, or assumptions does it rely on?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing
Scientific method:
1. **Form Single Hypothesis:** State clearly: *"I think X is the root cause because Y"*. Write it down.
2. **Test Minimally:** Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis. One variable at a time.
3. **Verify Before Continuing:** Did it work? Yes → Phase 4. Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis. DON'T add more fixes on top.
4. **When You Don't Know:** Say *"I don't understand X"*. Research more or ask for help.

### Phase 4: Implementation
Fix the root cause, not the symptom:
1. **Create Failing Test Case:** Simplest possible reproduction (automated test if possible). MUST have before fixing.
2. **Implement Single Fix:** Address the root cause identified. ONE change at a time. No "while I'm here" refactoring.
3. **Verify Fix:** Test passes now? No other tests broken? Issue actually resolved?
4. **If Fix Doesn't Work:**
   * **STOP.** Count how many fixes you have tried.
   * If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information.
   * If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (Step 5 below). DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion.
5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture:**
   * Pattern indicating architectural problem: Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling in different place or creates new symptoms.
   * STOP and question fundamentals: Is this pattern fundamentally sound? Are we sticking with it through sheer inertia?

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process
If you catch yourself thinking:
* *"Quick fix for now, investigate later"*
* *"Just try changing X and see if it works"*
* *"Add multiple changes, run tests"*
* *"Skip the test, I'll manually verify"*
* *"It's probably X, let me fix that"*
* *"I don't fully understand but this might work"*
* *"One more fix attempt"* (when already tried 2+)

> **ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations vs Reality

| Excuse | Reality |
| :--- | :--- |
| *"Issue is simple, don't need process"* | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| *"Emergency, no time for process"* | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| *"Just try this first, then investigate"* | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| *"Multiple fixes at once saves time"* | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| *"One more fix attempt"* (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference Summary

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |
